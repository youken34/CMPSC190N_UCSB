\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}
For the model, we can probably use something like a neural network instead of the standard random forest decision tree instead. The reason for this is because the relationships between factors seem to be non-linear and we need to be able to better process huge amounts of data, which we also lacked for this project.
The quality of the data is also in question, although there are definite differences in the average of the parameters we have considered, it didnâ€™t appear to be as impactful as originally hypothesized. In all likelihood, this is due to the music videos having some amounts of graphical changes as well, thus affecting the quality of the data.
