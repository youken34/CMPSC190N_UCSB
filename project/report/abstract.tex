\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Common ground}: Music videos obviously require less bandwidth to load than the gaming ones, furthermore, video games graphics and image quality have significantly increased over the years and are expected to continue advancing, resulting in distinct networking demands.
    \item \textbf{Disruption}: The first struggle we encountered arise from the range of data we were working on, since the provided dataset is limited to mere "videos", we were unable to accurately pick two videos respectively labeled as "gaming" and "audio only". Secondly, we ran into a server issue which prevented us from connecting to the right aws-fargate. Finally, we faced problems with files not updating correctly, as well as permission issues when attempting to modify.
    \item \textbf{Cost}: The consequences of the aforementioned roadblocks we encountered result in inefficient resource allocation, as resources are wasted on videos that do not require as much resources to play.
    \item \textbf{Resolution}:  In order to find accurate data to train our model, we manually picked two video, one for each category our machine learning model aims to classify. Regarding the server issue, we solved it by trying different servers / nodes. Lastly, when it comes to the files problems, we managed to find the correct paths to get rid of this issue.
